# Information
This is a tiny program I put together which gets the text content of a Wikipedia article, writes it to a text file, and moves to a different article. 
The process is completely randomized so you won't expect to see the same article being scraped more than once (at least most of the time). This program will not
receive many updates, so I may be slow to fix any bugs.

**Note that the program may get stuck at one point, so for now, you can just spam Ctrl+C or wait until it returns an error.**
